Use <strong>RedmineManagerFactory</strong> class as the entry point.
<p>
<strong>Logger configuration:</strong>
<p>Put a properties file with name "redmine.log.properties" anywhere in the classpath that contains one single entry (key/value pair) for the key "log.level".
The log level is global, there is no concept of configuring log levels for separate loggers.
