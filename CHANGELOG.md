#### Migration guide for version 3.0.0:

Issue class:
* Method deleted:    public String getCustomField(String fieldName).
 use the new getCustomFieldByName() method instead

IssueFactory class:
* Method deleted: public static Issue createWithSubject(String subject).
 Use create(int projectId, String subject) instead.

IssueManager class:
* Method deleted: createIssue(String projectKey, Issue issue).
 Use createIssue(Issue issue) instead. The old method had ambiguity in it: not clear which project key value
 to use when it is also set in the Issue itself.

A new TimeEntryManager is introduced. Its methods were extacted from IssueManager.
 
# Version 2.6.0 (November 11, 2015)
  
## ! This version has breaking API changes to address issue #222!
  
Migration for RedmineManagerFactory:

* createShortTermConfig(connectionManager) -> getNewHttpClient(connectionManager)
* createUnauthenticated(String uri, TransportConfiguration config) -> createUnauthenticated(String uri, HttpClient httpClient)
* similarly for other createXX() methods that required TransportConfiguration - they now work with HttpClient
  directly.
  
Also changes to address threading issues:

* deleted Pooling connections. createConnectionManagerWithExtraTrust(), createDefaultConnectionManager()
 and all similar methods now return ClientConnectionManager instead of PoolingClientConnectionManager.
* no more shutdown() method in RedmineManager. if you want to close HttpClient connections, do it directly
on HttpClient you create.
* no more createShortTermConfig() and createLongTermConfiguration() methods. create your own HttpClient
instances and pass them to RedmineManagerFactory if you want to control connection pooling, evictions, etc.

Other changes in 2.6.0:

* Apache HttpClient dependency is updated from 4.2 to v. 4.5.1
* Bug fixed: #229 "Unsupported class class Attachment" when calling attachmentManager.getAttachmentById() bug 

Internal changes in 2.6.0 (should not affect end-users):

* Integration tests are switched from HTTP to HTTPS to make sure HTTPS is supported alright.
* Switched from JUnit 4.10 to 4.12 (test scope dependency - will not affect consumers)
* Switched testing library from Fest-assert to AssertJ  (test scope dependency - will not affect consumers)


# Version 2.5.0 (October 17, 2015)

* Issue 214. new feature: support custom fields for Versions.
* Issue 219. new feature: support for additional keystores to enable SSL connections to servers
 with certificates issued by lesser-known authorities.
* Issue 220. minor improvement: added a method to GroupFactory to create Groups. 

# Version 2.4.0 (August 9, 2015)

* Issue 209 support free-form search for users
* when an object with NULL id is given to update() method in Transport class, it fails with NPE 
* add create(id) method to TrackerFactory class enhancement 
* Fix reading group members for memberships and fix failing unittest enhancement 

# Version 2.3.0 (July 11, 2015)

* Issue #201 Save custom fields for projects.
* Issue #195 Change in RedmineInternalError: it was derived from Error, now it extends RuntimeException
* Issue #114 #188 BREAKING change! getIssues(params map) does NOT handle paging anymore, you can/must use your own limit&offset http params.
note: same for all other object lists - Issue, User, Group, Project, ....
See detailed explanation for this change here: https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api/issues/114 .
The original API usage model was "load all objects at once" and fetching individual pages was never a goal.
OLD BEHAVIOR: You could previously use setObjectsPerPage() method on RedmineManager, but this only affected the internal page size used for loading issues. clients would only see the final result with all objects anyway.
Backward compatibility is important, of course. But in this case this method is totally misleading as couple people complained.
I believe fixing this bug is more important than maintaining compatibility.
